            <h2>Why Your Website Needs a Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>In today's digital landscape, trust is everything. A <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> is not just a legal document; it's a statement to your visitors that you respect their data. Whether you run a personal blog, an e-commerce store, or a small business website, transparency regarding data collection is mandatory in many jurisdictions.</p>
            
            <h3>Compliance with AdSense and GDPR</h3>
            <p>If you plan to monetize your website using <strong>Google AdSense</strong>, a privacy policy is strictly required. Google's policies mandate that you disclose the use of cookies, specifically the DoubleClick DART cookie, to your users. Failure to have a compliant policy can lead to your AdSense account being rejected or banned.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, regulations like the <strong>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</strong> in Europe and <strong>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</strong> in the US require websites to inform users about their rights regarding personal data. The <span style="color:var(--primary-color);">VIP Tool Privacy Policy Generator</span> helps you create a document that covers these essential bases automatically.</p>

            <h2>How to Use This Generator</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Enter Details:</strong> Fill in your website name, URL, and contact email address.</li>
                <li><strong>Select Options:</strong> Check the boxes if you use cookies, AdSense, or third-party advertisers.</li>
                <li><strong>Generate:</strong> Click the button to instantly create your custom policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Copy or Preview:</strong> Use the tabs to choose between HTML code or Text format for Word documents.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Is this policy legally binding?</h3>
            <p>While this tool generates a standard privacy policy covering common scenarios, we are not a law firm. For specific legal advice tailored to your unique business model, consultation with a legal professional is recommended.</p>

            <h3>2. Does it include cookie consent?</h3>
            <p>The policy includes a disclosure about cookie usage. However, for full GDPR compliance, you may also need a "Cookie Consent Banner" on your website to get active user permission.</p>

            <h3>3. Can I edit the generated text?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. The output is provided as raw HTML. You are encouraged to read through it and make any necessary adjustments to fit your specific needs.</p>
